For an introduction to the `strand` backtester, check out the [package vignette](https://github.com/strand-tech/strand/raw/master/vignettes/strand.pdf).

If you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed, you can run a sample strand shiny application by running the following commands from the top-level `strand` directory:

```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

The application will run by default on port 80. To configure edit `docker-compose.yml`.
